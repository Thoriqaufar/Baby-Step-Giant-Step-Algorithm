# Baby-Step-Giant-Step-Algorithm

The Baby Step Giant Step algorithm, also known as the Shanks' algorithm, is an efficient method used for computing discrete logarithms in a cyclic group. It's particularly useful in the context of modular arithmetic, cryptography, and number theory.

This algorithm can find 𝑥 that satisfies the equation 𝛼^𝑥 = 𝛽.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^(1/2)), which makes it significantly faster than naive approaches for computing discrete logarithms, especially for large groups.
